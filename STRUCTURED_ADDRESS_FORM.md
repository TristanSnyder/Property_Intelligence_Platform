# Structured Address Form Enhancement

## âœ… **Feature Implemented**

The system now supports structured address input with separate fields for each component instead of a single address field.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Benefits**

1. **Better Data Quality**: Separate fields reduce address parsing errors
2. **Improved Validation**: Can validate each component individually
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: Clearer input expectations
4. **Better Geocoding**: More accurate results with structured data
5. **State Validation**: Dropdown prevents invalid state entries

## ðŸ”§ **Backend Changes**

### Enhanced PropertyAnalysisRequest Model

```python
class PropertyAnalysisRequest(BaseModel):
    # Backward compatibility: single address field
    address: Optional[str] = None
    
    # New structured address fields
    street_address: Optional[str] = None
    city: Optional[str] = None
    state: Optional[str] = None
    zip_code: Optional[str] = None
    
    analysis_type: str = "comprehensive"
    additional_context: Optional[str] = ""
    
    def get_formatted_address(self) -> str:
        """Get the complete address, either from address field or structured fields"""
        if self.address:
            return self.address
        
        # Build address from structured fields
        address_parts = []
        if self.street_address:
            address_parts.append(self.street_address.strip())
        if self.city:
            address_parts.append(self.city.strip())
        if self.state:
            address_parts.append(self.state.strip())
        if self.zip_code:
            address_parts.append(self.zip_code.strip())
        
        return ", ".join(address_parts) if address_parts else ""
```

### Updated API Endpoint

- `/analyze-property` now accepts both formats
- Automatically combines structured fields into a formatted address
- Maintains backward compatibility with single address field
- Validates that at least one address format is provided

## ðŸŽ¨ **Frontend Changes (Streamlit)**

### New Structured Form

```python
# Row 1: Street Address
street_address = st.text_input(
    "Street Address",
    placeholder="123 Main Street",
    help="Enter the street number and street name"
)

# Row 2: City, State, ZIP Code
col_city, col_state, col_zip = st.columns([2, 1, 1])

with col_city:
    city = st.text_input("City", placeholder="New York")

with col_state:
    state = st.selectbox("State", options=["", "AL", "AK", ...])

with col_zip:
    zip_code = st.text_input("ZIP Code", placeholder="10001", max_chars=10)
```

### Features

- **Address Preview**: Shows combined address as you type
- **Validation**: Button disabled until all fields are complete
- **State Dropdown**: All 50 states + DC with proper validation
- **Real-time Feedback**: Clear indication of what's missing

## ðŸ”„ **API Request Format**

### New Format (Recommended)
```json
{
    "street_address": "3650 Dunigan Ct",
    "city": "Catharpin",
    "state": "VA",
    "zip_code": "20143",
    "analysis_type": "comprehensive",
    "additional_context": ""
}
```

### Legacy Format (Still Supported)
```json
{
    "address": "3650 Dunigan Ct, Catharpin, VA 20143",
    "analysis_type": "comprehensive",
    "additional_context": ""
}
```

## ðŸ“‹ **Example Usage**

### Successful Request
```
POST /analyze-property
{
    "street_address": "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue",
    "city": "Washington",
    "state": "DC",
    "zip_code": "20500"
}
```

### Response
```json
{
    "analysis_id": "uuid-here",
    "address": "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, DC, 20500",
    "status": "completed",
    "created_at": "2025-01-27T..."
}
```

## ðŸš€ **Ready for Testing**

The structured address form is now ready for testing:

1. **Streamlit Frontend**: Complete with validation and preview
2. **FastAPI Backend**: Handles both structured and legacy formats
3. **Address Processing**: Properly combines fields for geocoding
4. **Error Handling**: Clear messages for incomplete addresses

## ðŸ’¡ **Future Enhancements**

- Auto-complete for cities based on state selection
- ZIP code validation against city/state
- International address support
- Address verification integration
- Bulk address import
